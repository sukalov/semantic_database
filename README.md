# Semantic Database
PY codes combining information from semantic tables into a unite XML


## current problems with fulldic:
1. table lacks lexemes in many rows
2. same lexemes are written many times (as many, as the amount of microframes for the lexeme)

purpose: one lexeme tag and all microframe tags inside
